"""Is this image a chart?  Two-stage gate.

Stage 1 (preferred): a CLIP zero-shot classifier. We embed the image and a set
of "chart" vs "not a chart" text prompts and see which group the image is closer
to. This is far more robust than pixel statistics — it recognises charts by
content, not by "has a white background".

Stage 2 (fallback): a cheap pixel heuristic (flat-background ratio + limited
color palette). Used only when CLIP can't run — torch/transformers not
installed, the model can't be downloaded, or inference fails. So the gate keeps
working (degraded) on a machine without the ML deps.

The model team can later replace the CLIP stage with their own fine-tuned
classifier; the contract is unchanged: ``looks_like_chart(bytes) -> (bool, float)``.

Fails open everywhere: if nothing can decide, we assume it IS a chart
(confidence 1.0) so we never show a false "unreliable" warning.
