"""Inference seam between the webapp and the model team's work.

This is the ONE place the backend goes through to get an answer. For now it
returns a deterministic mock so the full UI + API can be built and tested
end-to-end. When Susanne & Omar's model is ready, they implement
``model_adapter.predict`` and flip the mock off — no backend or frontend code
here needs to change.

Contract (see docs/PLAN.md §5):
    run_inference(image_bytes: bytes, question: str) -> str

Switching to the real model:
    1. Implement ``predict(image_bytes, question) -> str`` in model_adapter.py.
    2. Run the backend with USE_MOCK=0 (env var) — no code edit required.
