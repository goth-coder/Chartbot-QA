"""Prometheus metrics for the backend — fail-open.

If ``prometheus_client`` isn't installed, every helper is a no-op and ``/metrics``
returns a short notice, so observability is never a hard dependency (same spirit as the
guards and the answer cache). When it IS installed, the backend exposes request counts,
per-stage latency histograms, guard-block reasons, answer-cache hit/miss, and VLM
invocation counts — enough to see **which layer spends the time** and **how often the
expensive VLM path fires** (= cost).
